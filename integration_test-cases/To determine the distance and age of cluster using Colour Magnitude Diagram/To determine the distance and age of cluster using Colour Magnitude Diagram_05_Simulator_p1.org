* Objective
  - To view the simulation of  “Colour Magnitude Diagram” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/virtual-astrophysics-lab-iitk/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/To determine the distance and age of cluster using Colour Magnitude Diagram/To determine the distance and age of cluster using Colour Magnitude Diagram_01_Usability_smk.org][To determine the distance and age of cluster using Colour Magnitude Diagram_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the“Colour Magnitude Diagram” experimentlink 
  2. It should re-direct to the experiment home page
  3. Click on the 'click here' link present under the User manual
  4. select the data file from the drop down list displayed on the screen
  5. Don't enter the 'mv' value in the corresponding field and click on the add button and vice-versa

* Expected result
  1. Experiment home page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new tab should be opened with the simulation process
  4. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to enter the 'mv' value and vice-versa

* Review/comments
